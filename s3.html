       <h2 style="color: blue;">What is Javascript?</h2><br><p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production (along with HTML and CSS). It is used to make web pages interactive and provide dynamic features. JavaScript is also used in many non-browser environments, such as game development and server-side programming.
        JavaScript is a text-based programming language that can be used on both client and server-side. It controls multimedia within web pages and allows them to become interactive. JavaScript empowers a developer to do many things like adding animation to images or updating content automatically on a page.
